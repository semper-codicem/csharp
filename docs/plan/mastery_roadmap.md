# üåü C# / .NET Mastery Roadmap

---

## **Phase 1: Deepen Core C# Knowledge (3‚Äì4 weeks)**

**Goal:** Move beyond ‚Äúworking knowledge‚Äù into **language internals**.

**Topics:**

* Advanced generics (constraints, variance).
* Delegates, events, expression trees.
* Value types vs reference types (stack vs heap).
* Memory & Span (`Span<T>`, `Memory<T>`).
* Unsafe code & pointers.

**Exercises:**

* Implement a **generic cache** with constraints.
* Build a LINQ-like **mini query provider** using expression trees.
* Use `Span<T>` to parse CSV strings without allocations.

**Project:**
Write a **high-performance CSV parser** library that can read millions of rows using `Span<T>` and `ArrayPool<T>`. Benchmark with BenchmarkDotNet.

---

## **Phase 2: CLR, IL & Runtime Internals (4‚Äì6 weeks)**

**Goal:** Understand how your C# code actually executes under the hood.

**Topics:**

* CLR execution, JIT, Tiered Compilation, NativeAOT.
* Garbage Collection internals.
* Assemblies, IL, reflection.
* Benchmarking & profiling.
* Threading model.

**Exercises:**

* Disassemble simple methods with ILDasm.
* Compare `struct` vs `class` in memory allocations (PerfView).
* Benchmark `List<T>` vs `Span<T>` parsing.
* Write a simple **reflection-based serializer**.

**Project:**
Build a **mini performance profiler** that times methods via `DispatchProxy` or IL weaving. Compare results with BenchmarkDotNet.

---

## **Phase 3: Asynchrony & Parallelism (3‚Äì5 weeks)**

**Goal:** Master async/await, TPL, and concurrency at scale.

**Topics:**

* async/await state machine internals.
* Task Parallel Library.
* Synchronization primitives.
* Channels & Pipelines.
* Reactive Extensions.

**Exercises:**

* Implement your own **Task scheduler**.
* Use `SemaphoreSlim` to throttle concurrent API calls.
* Build a producer/consumer pipeline with `System.Threading.Channels`.

**Project:**
Create a **real-time stock ticker** app:

* Fetch live data.
* Use pipelines for processing.
* Push updates to subscribers using Rx.NET.

---

## **Phase 4: Advanced Architecture & Patterns (6‚Äì8 weeks)**

**Goal:** Apply advanced design to enterprise systems.

**Topics:**

* Clean Architecture & SOLID in depth.
* DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing.
* Dependency Injection (built-in, Autofac).
* AOP with proxies.
* Source Generators & Roslyn.

**Exercises:**

* Refactor a simple CRUD API into Clean Architecture layers.
* Implement a CQRS command/query separation in an app.
* Write a **source generator** to auto-implement DTO ‚Üí Entity mapping.

**Project:**
Develop a **modular e-commerce API**:

* Orders, payments, users.
* CQRS for reads/writes.
* Event sourcing for order history.
* Pluggable architecture with DI.

---

## **Phase 5: Advanced Data & LINQ (3‚Äì4 weeks)**

**Goal:** Push LINQ and EF Core to expert level.

**Topics:**

* IQueryable vs IEnumerable.
* Writing custom LINQ providers.
* Compiled queries in EF Core.
* Expression tree manipulation.

**Exercises:**

* Build a **LINQ provider** that translates to SQL-like strings.
* Optimize EF Core queries with compiled queries.
* Write a **query pipeline** with expression trees.

**Project:**
Create a **custom in-memory LINQ engine**:

* Supports `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`.
* Executes queries over JSON datasets.

---

## **Phase 6: Systems Programming & Interop (4‚Äì6 weeks)**

**Goal:** Work with low-level .NET features.

**Topics:**

* P/Invoke and native interop.
* Unsafe code and fixed buffers.
* Reflection.Emit and dynamic code gen.
* Networking: sockets, pipelines, gRPC.

**Exercises:**

* Call a C library function from C# using P/Invoke.
* Implement a memory pool with unsafe code.
* Build a gRPC server and client with streaming.

**Project:**
Write a **high-performance TCP chat server**:

* Socket-based.
* Uses Pipelines for zero-copy reads.
* Benchmark vs Kestrel.

---

## **Phase 7: Enterprise-Grade .NET (Ongoing, 2‚Äì3 months)**

**Goal:** Become production-ready at scale.

**Topics:**

* Distributed caching (Redis, NCache).
* Messaging (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
* Observability (OpenTelemetry, logging, metrics).
* Microservices in .NET.
* Cloud-native: containers, Kubernetes.

**Exercises:**

* Add Redis caching to your e-commerce API.
* Stream order events to Kafka.
* Add OpenTelemetry tracing.

**Project:**
Deploy your **modular e-commerce API** as a **microservice system**:

* Multiple services (Orders, Payments, Users).
* Communicate over gRPC or Kafka.
* Deploy to Kubernetes.

---

## **Phase 8: Expert Level (Never-ending mastery)**

**Goal:** Be able to **debug, optimize, and design systems like a .NET architect**.

**Activities:**

* Contribute to open source (`dotnet/runtime`, `roslyn`).
* Read CLR via C# (by Jeffrey Richter).
* Explore .NET internals blogs & GitHub repos.
* Mentor juniors, do code reviews.
* Build real-world OSS libraries.
