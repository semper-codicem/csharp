  * JIT compilation and tiered compilation
  * Garbage Collection (GC generations, large object heap)
  * Value types vs. reference types: memory layout
* **Assemblies and IL (Intermediate Language)**:

  * Use `ildasm`, `ILSpy`, or `dnSpy`
* **AppDomains and Assembly loading (older but useful knowledge)**
